First I would express my deepest love for Dr.\,Anna DÃ¼nser, who is not only an emotional support for me but also an excellent scientific discussion partner and proof reading expert. My family who are always open minded and support me in any circumstances. I would like to thank Prof.\,Dr.\,Edith Stabentheiner for helping me in my endeavour to get the approval for my individual master programme. The University of Graz and Technical University of Graz for creating the environment for my education. The manifold unsung heros of the internet, who answer questions on Stackoverflow or create amazing open source software, for without them this work would simply not be possible. A special thanks to the 'R4DS Online Learning Community' which I'm a proud member of and August Comte for always answering my statistical questions.

Of course I could not have written my master thesis without the freedom given by my supervisor Dr.\,Robert Brodschneider, the driving person behind the yearly survey on winter colony losses in Austria and who was always available if needed. My appreciation for the COLOSS network in their active honeybee research. Furthermore and the biggest thanks belongs to the participating beekeepers who were willing to help with the research about honeybees in Austria and by this helping me directly with my master thesis.
