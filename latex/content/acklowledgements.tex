I would like to thank Prof.\,Dr.\,Edith Stabentheiner for helping me in my endeavour to get my approval to study my own individual master programme. The University of Graz and Technical University of Graz for creating the environment of education. The manifold unsung heros of the internet, who answer questions on Stackoverflow or create amazing open source software, for without them this work would not be possible. A special thanks to the 'R4DS Online Learning Community' which I'm a proud member of and August Comte for always answering my statistical questions.

Ofcourse I could not have written my master thesis without the freedom given by my supervisor Dr.\,Robert Brodschneider, the driving person behind the yearly survey on winter colony losses in Austria and who was always available if needed. Appreciation for the network COLOSS for their active bee research and 'Zukunft Biene' for the financial support of the bee research in Austria. Furthermore and the biggest thanks belongs to the participating beekeeper who were willing to help with the research about honeybees in Austria and by this helping me directly with my master thesis.
