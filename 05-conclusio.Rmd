# Conclusion

The total economic burden by the introduced aggressor *Varroa destructor* are substantial on the other side the importance of honey bees for the society is indisputable. The results of the survey gives a first ever estimation and extrapolation of the treatment expenses for beekeepers in Austria. It underlays empirically a small fraction of this burden with sums already to a few million Euro on national scale. The motivations why beekeepers choose their treatment methods showed the high resonance of intrinsics motives for their honey bees, 'Side effects on bees', and awareness of 'Residues'. It also shows a differences in goals and beliefs of smaller hobbyist beekeepers, who depend more on external information and less motivated by time or costs, which is more important for bigger operation who are probably more financial driven. 

In Austria the domination of organic acids as treatment methods is probably reflected as part of their motivations. Single treatments in summer with formic acid showed once again not enough efficacy on average. The most common treatment combination of formic acid long term in summer and oxalic acid trickling in winter results on consistently lower loss rates. Without labour costs the uptake of biotechnical methods seems to be more economical and depending on the method it may less harmful for honey bees with no risk of residues or resistances. The reduction of pesticides should be a main goal, in which biotechnical methods can help. As the treatment against varroa mites is now since over 40 years in Europa the dominant topic in beekeeping, a lot of effort and time is invested by breeders and scientists to select for honey bees who can defend or live with the mites without treatment, but so far without any major adaptation or success [@mondet2020a;@mondet2020;@guichard2020;@bubnic2021]. The economic way of beekeeping with high density of colonies and swarm reduction techniques will probably always rely on active pest control. Nevertheless, natural directed selection may be a solution to keep healthier honey bee colonies [@seeley2007a;@locke2016;@neumann2017;@buchler2020;@oddie2021]. This phenomena is already observed as several honey bee populations in Europe that actively hinder the Varroa mite in its development through their behaviour and they may also exist in Austria [@mondet2020;@oberreiter2021].

The uncertain range of the my results and the effort on data cleaning did show some disadvantages of our survey. An alternative approach for evaluating the economic values or impact would be to work more closely with beekeeping operations for a thorough result. This was done for example in a detailed economic breakdown of honey bee queen breeding in Canada [@bixby2020] or in an economic evaluation of biotechnical methods [@mancuso2020]. Although, the advantages of the survey are probably higher, e.g. using an already established survey and getting more answers in addition to lower workload and costs to get the data. Additionally my thesis is showing the importance of ongoing surveys to evaluate and observe trends and changes in the beekeeping community. For the beekeepers the results are information of their coequal and for national beekeeping clubs and politics the results can be used to find out more about the needs in the beekeeping community and to help in their political decision making.
