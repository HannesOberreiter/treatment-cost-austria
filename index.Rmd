abstract: Summary of Stats and Statistics for Treatment Costs Varroa. Our Hypothesis
  is that the costs have an influence or correlated to the winter losses. H0 = Costs
  have no influence on survival rate, H1 = Costs have an influence on the survival
  rate.

# Preface {-}

The analysis of the citizen science survey data was conducted over the years 2020 and 2021. For full reproducibility and in the mindset of open source, we publish all our code in a GitHub repository. This should help to understand our approach and give a good starting point for other studies and countries who want to do a similar study.
