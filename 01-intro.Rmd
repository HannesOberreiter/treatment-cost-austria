# Introduction

The economic and ecology value, the importance of feeding mankind by pollinating crops by wild bees and honey bees cannot be denied [@kearns1998;@klein2007;@gallai2009]. Furthermore managed honey bee colonies improve the quality and amount of harvest for various crops, as example oilseed rape, sunflowers and brassica vegetables [@krause1981;@sushil2013]. There may be a lot more benefits which are often overlooked, for example the bee colonies fertilizing effect of bee frass in foraging areas, which at least under study control did show a significant release of inorganic nitrogen into the soil [@mishra2013]. A market analysis from England showed the economic value of pollination, honey, and beeswax estimated by Â£800 per colony in the year 1992 [@carreck1998]. Even though we already know and even learn each day more about importance of insect in our ecosystem an alarming decline of wild pollinators can be seen over the last years [@hallmann2017;@sanchez-bayo2019]. The reasons for the decline seem manifold: parasites; pathogens; environmental pollution; rapid climate change, loss of insect friendly habitats etc. [@biesmeijer2006;@potts2010;@goulson2015;@woodcock2017].

With the economic and ecology value of honey bees in mind I want to look at the expenses and treatment efficiency of varroa mite control methods in Austria. The varroa mite, *Varroa destructor*, is worldwide, with some exceptions, an active threat to apiculture [@dahle2010;@morawetz2019;@rosenkranz2010;@genersch2010;@noel2020;@roth2020]. In Austria the beekeepers have to cope with this imported aggressor since (REFERENZ) and need to treat their colonies to prevent unacceptable financial losses, as most untreated colonies would die off within 2-3 years [@rosenkranz2010]. The control of the mite in Austria is mainly done with organic acids (eg. formic acid, oxalic acid), essential oils (thymol), synthetic acrazides or biotechnical methods [@oberreiter2020]. Each of these treatment methods has it advantages and or disadvantages and most of the time beekeeper use a combination of them [@rosenkranz2010]. Though, the treatment alone does not guaranteed the survival of colonies, studies show that the education, experience and correct application and timing of treatment plays an important role [@jacques2017;@morawetz2019;@brodschneider2013;@vanderzee2014].

In the foreground of this work is an exploratory analysis of a citizen science survey data from the years 2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21. The survey is carried out since 2008 by the Institute of Biology at the University of Graz to collect data on winter losses of bee colonies [@brodschneider2013]. In the past three years the participants could also answers an optional question about their expenses of treatment per bee colony, without labor costs. This question is the main focus of this study, as such a descriptive analysis of treatment expenses has never been carried out in Austria in this form before. In addition the treatment methods and their efficiency are compared to the direct costs to give possible valuable input for beekeepers for their decision making on which methods are a good option for their operation. Since different methods are not always equally successful in treatment previous carried out studies from the same citizen science survey [@brodschneider2013;@crailsheim2018;@oberreiter2020] and probably also cause different expenses, the expenditure per colony could mean a direct correlation with the winter colony losses for the beekeeper. Additionally higher losses mean additional costs for the beekeeping business.
