# Introduction

The economic and ecology value and importance of feeding mankind by pollinating crops by wild bees and honey bees cannot be denied [@kearns1998; @klein2007; @gallai2009]. That managed honey bee colonies improve the quality and amount of harvest for various crops is well studied, as example oilseed rape, sunflowers and brassica vegetables [@krause1981; @sushil2013]. Another not so well studied value of beecolonies could be the the biomass of dying bees in the area or a fertilizing effect of bee frass in foraging areas, which at least under study control did show significant release of inorganic Nitrogen into the soil [@mishra2013]. An market analysis from England showed the economic value of pollination, honey, and beeswax estimated by Â£800 per colony in the year 1992 [@carreck1998]. Sadly a strong decline of very important wild pollinators can also be seen over the last years [@hallmann2017; @sanchez-bayo2019].

With this economic value in mind we want to look at the expenses, which the beekeepers in Austria have to cope to treat their colonies against the imported *Varroa destructor* with the use of medication. In the foreground of the work is an exploratory analysis of a citizen science survey data from the years 2018/19 and 2019/20. The survey is carried out since 2008 by the Institute of Biology at the University of Graz to collect data on winter losses of bee colonies [@brodschneider2013]. In the past two years the participants could also answers a question about the costs of treatment per bee colony.

Such a descriptive analysis of treatment expenses has never been carried out in Austria in this form before. However, the data could clearly show how great the economic burden for beekeeping, caused by the introduced aggressor, is and could yield valuable information about the dimensions of the Austrian treatment agent market.

Secondly, we deal with the hypothesis whether there is a connection between the amount of costs used for control and the loss rates of bee colonies in winter. Since different methods are not always equally successful in treatment previous carried out studies from the same citizen science survey [@brodschneider2013; @crailsheim2018; @oberreiter2020] and probably also cause different expenses, the expenditure per colony could mean a direct correlation with the winter colony losses for the beekeeper. Additionally higher losses mean additional costs for the beekeeping business.
