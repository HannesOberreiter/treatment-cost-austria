# Introduction

The economic and ecological value and the importance of feeding mankind by crop pollination of wild bees and the honey bee (*Apis mellifera*) cannot be denied [@kearns1998;@klein2007;@gallai2009]. Managed honey bee colonies improve the quality and amount of harvest for various crops, for example oilseed rape, sunflowers and brassica vegetables [@krause1981;@sushil2013]. An economic market analysis from England showed the value of pollination, honey, and beeswax estimated by £&nbsp;800 per colony in the year 1992 [@carreck1998]. If one adds the society benefit from pollination as done in a study in the U.S. the worth of honey bees was estimated with USD&nbsp;1.6-8.3 billion per year [@southwick1992]. Another example from Germany about the economic value for pollination performance in food crop cultivation and net value of honey and wax production was estimated with EUR&nbsp;1.72 billion [@barrios2017]. For the whole of Europe the annual value of the apiculture sector was estimated with EUR&nbsp;one billion and for pollination EUR&nbsp;22 billion per year [@commission2014]. There may be a lot more benefits which are often overlooked or simply not well enough researched, for example the bee colonies fertilizing effect of bee frass in foraging areas, which at least under study control did show a significant release of inorganic nitrogen into the soil [@mishra2013]. Or their participation in the food chain as important nutrient source for predators, as such the bee-eaters (Meropidae) with an average 15-25% of honey bees in their diets [@fry1983]. Bee-eaters feed in addition on pests which makes them beneficial for agriculture and maybe even for apiculture itself [@fry1983]. Nevertheless, @southwick1992 made it clear in their discussion that we do not only profit from honey bees but also from wild pollinators and should improve their environment and create conservation zones. These examples about the importance of insects makes the alarming decline of wild pollinators over the last years even more catastrophic for us and the ecosystem [@hallmann2017;@sanchez-bayo2019]. The reasons for the decline seem manifold: parasites; pathogens; environmental pollution; rapid climate change, loss of insect friendly habitats etc. [e.g. @biesmeijer2006;@potts2010;@goulson2015;@woodcock2017].

With the economic and ecology value of honey bees in mind I want to look at the expenses and treatment efficiency of varroa mite control methods in Austria. The varroa mite, *Varroa destructor*, is worldwide with some exceptions, an active threat to apiculture [e.g. @dahle2010;@rosenkranz2010;@genersch2010;@morawetz2019;@noel2020;@roth2020]. Varroosis, the disease caused by varroa mites, is one of the most frequently observed honey bee disease in Austria. It is related to a high varroa mite infestation and does increase the risk of colony losses [@morawetz2019]. Although, colony losses are not only caused by varroa damage, the financial loss oft lost and weak colonies is substantial for the apiculture sector [@popovskastojanov2021]. In addition for beekeepers the varroa pest leads to an increase of costs in labour, material expenses on treatment and replacement of lost colonies [@nationalresearchcouncil2007;@vanengelsdorp2010a]. In the US, were pollination services are a big industry for beekeepers, the spread of varroa mites and colony collapse disorder (CCD) did came at the same time as higher prices paid by farmers for pollination service [@carman2011;@rucker2012]. Indicating in real world examples that the introduced varroa mite and colony losses do not only impact economically beekeepers but also the food production industry and making the importance of pollination services of insects visible [@kearns1998;@klein2007;@gallai2009].

In Austria and most other central european countries the beekeepers have to cope with this imported aggressor since the 1980s [@griffiths1981;@potts2010a]. In Germany a small scale survey did show that pests are perceived as the main challenges for beekeepers followed by poor landscape for foraging due to monocultures [@barrios2017]. Beekeepers need to treat their colonies to prevent unacceptable level of colony losses, as most untreated colonies would die off within 2-3 years [@rosenkranz2010]. The first years after the mite domination in Europe and the resulting treating effort in combination with other socio-economic factors may have led to a sharp decline of beekeepers [@potts2010a;@brodschneider2011]. Although in Austria the number of beekeeper and honey bee colonies is steadily growing over the past 7 years.[^biene-österreich] The control of the mite in Austria is mainly done with organic acids (e.g. formic acid, oxalic acid), essential oils (thymol) or biotechnical methods and less often with synthetic acaricides [@oberreiter2020]. Each of these treatment methods has it advantages and disadvantages and most of the time beekeepers use a combination of them [@rosenkranz2010;@noel2020;@oberreiter2020]. Though, the treatment alone does not guarantee the survival of colonies, studies show that the education, experience and correct application and timing of treatment plays an important role [@brodschneider2013;@vanderzee2014;@jacques2017;@morawetz2019].

Additionally I want to look at the main motivations for choosing a treatment method. This empirical approach to evaluate the motivations behind management practices against the varroa mite was never done before. Somewhat similar studies from the U.S. did identify different types of philosophies in management practices [@thoms2019;@underwood2019]. The focus of these studies was quite novel to the already rich literature of most topics in beekeeping. As the U.S. is quite different in their beekeeping structure, it is important to create similar socioecological studies in Austria.

In the foreground of this work is an exploratory analysis of a citizen science survey from the winters 2018/19, 2019/20 and 2020/21. The survey is carried out since 2008 by the Institute of Biology at the University of Graz to collect data on winter losses of managed honey bee colonies [@brodschneider2013]. In the past three years the participants could also answer an optional question about their expenses of treatment per honey bee colony, without labour costs and in the last year an additional question why they chose their varroa control methods. These two question are the main focus of this study, as such a descriptive analysis of treatment expenses and motivational reasons has never been carried out in this form before. Furthermore, the selected treatment methods and their efficiency, based on reported winter colony losses, are compared in combination with their expenses to give valuable input for beekeepers in their decision making process.
