# Introduction

The economic and ecology value, the importance of feeding mankind by pollinating crops by wild bees and honey bees cannot be denied [@kearns1998; @klein2007; @gallai2009]. Furthermore managed honey bee colonies improve the quality and amount of harvest for various crops, as example oilseed rape, sunflowers and brassica vegetables [@krause1981; @sushil2013]. There may be a lot more benefits which are often overlooked, for example the bee colonies fertilizing effect of bee frass in foraging areas, which at least under study control did show significant release of inorganic Nitrogen into the soil [@mishra2013]. A market analysis from England showed the economic value of pollination, honey, and beeswax estimated by Â£800 per colony in the year 1992 [@carreck1998]. Sadly, even though we learn each day more about importance of insect in our ecosystem a alarming decline of wild pollinators can be seen over the last years [@hallmann2017; @sanchez-bayo2019]. The reasons for the decline seem manifold: parasites; pathogens; environmental pollution; rapid climate change, loss of insect friendly habitats etc. [@biesmeijer2006; @potts2010; @goulson2015; @woodcock2017].

With the economic value in mind we want to look at the expenses, which the beekeepers in Austria have to cope to treat their colonies with medication against the imported aggressor *Varroa destructor*. The varroa mite is worldwide the largest threat to apiculture [@dahle2010; @morawetz2019; @rosenkranz2010; @genersch2010; @noel2020; @roth2020]. The control of the mite in Austria is mainly done with organic acids (eg. formic acid, oxalic acid), essential oils (thymol), synthetic acrazides or biotechnical methods [@oberreiter2020]. Each of these treatment methods has it advantages and or disadvantages and most of the time beekeeper use a combination of them [@rosenkranz2010]. Though, the treatment alone does not guaranteed the survival of colonies, studies show that the education, experience and correct application and timing of treatment plays an important role [@jacques2017; @morawetz2019; @brodschneider2013; @vanderzee2014].

In the foreground of this work is an exploratory analysis of a citizen science survey data from the years 2018/19 and 2019/20. The survey is carried out since 2008 by the Institute of Biology at the University of Graz to collect data on winter losses of bee colonies [@brodschneider2013]. In the past two years the participants could also answers an optional question about their expenses of treatment per bee colony, without labor costs. Such a descriptive analysis of treatment expenses has never been carried out in Austria in this form before. However, the data could clearly show how great the economic burden for beekeeping, caused by the introduced aggressor, is and could yield valuable information about the dimensions of the Austrian treatment agent market.

Secondly, we deal with the hypothesis whether there is a connection between the amount of costs used for control and the loss rates of bee colonies in winter. Since different methods are not always equally successful in treatment previous carried out studies from the same citizen science survey [@brodschneider2013; @crailsheim2018; @oberreiter2020] and probably also cause different expenses, the expenditure per colony could mean a direct correlation with the winter colony losses for the beekeeper. Additionally higher losses mean additional costs for the beekeeping business.
