(ref:size-permutation) Median difference null distribution (gray bars) based on 5,000 permutations. Red Line point estimate for median difference, yellow area 95% confidence interval of point estimate. Red shadow indicating the calculated two-sided *p*-value range on the null distribution. If *p*-value is reported as "\*\*\*" more permutation would be needed to calculate a precise *p*-value.
