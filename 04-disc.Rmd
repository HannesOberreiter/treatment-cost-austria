## Estimates



## Efficancy & Economics

Interpretation careful as confidence intervals for loss rates are overlapping between combinations and the standard errors for expenses are rather wide. 

One of the least efficient and also economical treatment method was the single application of formic acid long term treatment in summer. 




## Limitations and Sample Representative 

The survey was only online available and was not mandatory. Therefore, we cannot say that our sample represents the beekeeper population in Austria as the sample was not selected randomly from the population [@vanderzee2013]. In Austria all Beekeeprs must officially register with the "Veterin√§rinformationssystem" part of the Statistics Austria, but access to this data is limited and only available for prevention of diseases and therefore we cannot use this dataset to select a random sampel of the beekeepers population. Therefore, estimates should be viewed with cautions, and could have a potential selection biases and survey errors [@heeringa2010]. The experience from previous surveys results about the colony losses and the relatively high participation rate and different operation sizes are still a good indicator for a good sample.


In the evaluation, no correction is made for the accumulation of the alpha error, since different hypotheses are tested in our questionnaire and possible overlaps of the hypotheses are difficult to classify. Therefore, we try to keep the same questions over several years to reduce the probability of error in the statistics. An analysed risk factor that shows a significant influence on winter losses over several years probably has a stronger significance. However, analysed factors may also be subject to a correlation with an annual variable such as weather \citep{switanek2017}.
