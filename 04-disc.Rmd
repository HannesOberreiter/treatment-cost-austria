## Sample Representative and Limitations

In the yearly citizens science survey a decrease in the number of participants was observed. The lower number of partaking beekeepers can partly be explained by the popularity and rise of new beekeepers in Austria, which could be growing quicker than the spreading of information about the survey (Table \@ref(tab:registered)). Still I would have expected an increase of participants because in 2016 new rules made it obligatory for beekeepers who want to participate in the bee health programm to fill out the yearly winter loss survey. Beekeeper who are part of the bee health programme are allowed to apply and/or get a higher rate of government aid for investments in technical equipment to improve production quality and hygiene in their beekeeping operation.^[AgrarMarkt Austria, 06/2021 - Version 04] Before this indirect monetary incentive, there were no advantages or personal rewards for participants of the survey. Other than being part of it, as it was purley on a voluntary basis. Incentives showed in an analysis of two meta-studies an increase of survey responses and also a lower drop-out rate [@goritz2006]. Although the effect or higher motivation due to incentives is rather small  [@goritz2006;@bruggen2011]. On this note, one of the strong major motivation for beekeeper to participate in citizens science ecological field studies is to be able to contribute to the scientific knowledge [@gratzer2021]. This high rate of participants with intrinsically motivation was also identified for online surveys [@bruggen2011]. The winter colony loss survey is probably an in-between and cannot be described purely as a citizens science study or a simple online survey. Nevertheless, to increase and improve the retention of beekeeper participating in the survey the project should strive for better communication of the goal and how it improves the beekeeping knowledge and new ways of acknowledgement for each personal contribution of the volunteers [@nov2014]. One idea would be personalized automated reports of the results, were the individual results are compared to the total observed results. 

As with the majority of monitoring survey studies, the design is subject to limitations. The observed results are the first limitation as from a statistical standpoint, we cannot say strictly that our sample represents the beekeeper population in Austria as the sample was not selected randomly from the population [@vanderzee2013]. In Austria all beekeepers must officially register in VIS[^r-vis], but access to this data is limited and only available for prevention of diseases. A random stratified selection out of all beekeepers would be an ideal situation, which would help to prevent potential selection biases and survey errors [@heeringa2010;@vanderzee2013]. With this in mind point estimates and results should be viewed with caution. The participating beekeeper in the survey are from close to all country districts, indicating a good spatial coverage, and a response rate of 3.5-4.0% summarises to around 1.000 participants each year. Based on the rules of thumbs from @roscoe1975, a multivariate analyses should typically have 10% more responses than questions and cover all answering groups with an appropriate number of answers (*n* = 30). In addition for permutation tests, which were used in the two level factor analysis (Section \@ref(two-level)), the combination of skewed data and unequal sample sizes could lead to possible loss of power [@christensen2021]. To account for the low sample sizes in certain groups the three years of survey can help to view certain results as more robust, if the same results were observed in each year, or weak, if this is not the case. For the second concern a rank based permutation test was performed with bootstrap confidence interval to not only rely on a single point estimate and visualize the test results.

Methodically a lot of care was taken to identify outliers and imputation of some answers. For good practice and to minimize arbitrary decisions different statistical methods were applied and my knowledge about the different expenses of various treatment methods were taken into account [@kwak2017]. Still, this imputation, which can be seen as an act of data manipulation, should not be taken too lightly. With my methodical transparent approach and the public availability of the source code I try to take care of possible arguments of manipulative intentions. The reported inference based statistics are without correction of the alpha error, since different hypotheses are tested in the questionnaire as it is mostly explorative and possible overlaps of the hypotheses are difficult to classify. The advantage of the COLOSS questionnaire is that the questions are the same over several years, this is mainly because of interactions with temporal effects for example the weather which has shown to impact the winter colony survival [@switanek2017;@becsi2021]. The repetition additionally helps to reduce the probability of false inferences in statistics, if the same results can be observed over multiple years. The questionnaire itself can be seen as a tool to identify possible risk factors and compare the results in a standardised way with other countries part of COLOSS [@brodschneider2016;@brodschneider2018]. The identified risk factors can then be followed up by research with specific experimental design, for example the observed crippled wings by beekeepers with a study about the viral load [@morawetz2019].

Another point which may is a limitation is the survey data quality. Especially for the question about estimated treatment expenses per colony without labor costs. The data distribution showed that participants mostly answered in full round numbers, eg. 5 or 10 euro. This rounding leads to less variance between groups. Beekeepers answering on this question without simple estimates would need to keep books on their expenses or spend more effort when answering the survey, to find out how much they actually spend. I believe that this is not the case for the majority, as most participants probably see beekeeping as a hobby and do not keep track of their expenses. Additionally, the position of the question in the questionnaire could have a negative effect as it placed at the end of the survey. Although the structure does not seems to play a major role on data quality in postal survey [@dunn2003].

## Motivation choosing Varroa control method

The motivation why participants use a specific method was interesting to see, as it shows that the economic costs do not play a major role in selection. 'Efficacy' which was picked by the majority as one selection is the most important factor. This makes absolutely sense, as you want to apply method which work. Ofcourse the question is were a beekeeper learns that his specific method if efficacy. Is it their own observation of recommendation. Overall if the highest single answer given was recommendations by beekeeping associations, extenesion workers, magazine etc. which shows the high influence from outside. Side effects on bees and Residues are also playing a big part, only a handful of survey participants use synthetic methods (include Amitraz, Coumaphos, and other synthetic) which would leave detectabel residues in the beeswax !!

## Data Distribution and Estimation 

The non normal distribution of reported treatment expenses per colony was expected as not all treatment methods have the same expenses involved. It is also good that on average the estimated expenses and survey responses overlap are similar with some exceptions. One of this major overestimation are treatment methods including 'Another Biotechnical Method', the treatment method excludes in our case hyperthermia and drone brood removal, which are asked by its own. Still the method included a variety of possible methods, starting from queen caging with a small plastic clip to a more expensive full frame stainless steel cage. Therefore, the estimate was already difficult to calculate. Another reasons why we overestimated is probably because we did calculate for example a full frame cage as a material costs which is at least 5 years in use. I except beekeeper to answer simply with zero costs on this question if they A) build their own cage without thinking about material costs B) bought the cage a few years ago and answering here therefore with zero expenses in the survey year. The underestimation of single use of formic acid treatment methods could be due to the application frequencies, if one only uses one of these methods, the beekeeper in question maybe applies more often the method itself. This is not in the question as we only ask if they applied in at least one in a month. Another reason for over- and underestimation is the distribution of survey responses, we compare the mean which is influenced by outliers. Although a lot of care taken before the analysis, there could be still outliers inside the data. One of the reasons why we only look at treatment method combinations with at least multiple answers.

## Extrapolation

The varroa treatment agent market was never estimated in Austria, with the data in hand we allowed us to an rough extrapolation. One have to think about that these expenses are a direct impact of an introduced aggressor, which not even need to be here (referenze seit wann varroa da ist?). This extrapolation was carried out with two method, one by arithmetic mean, which is influenced by high outliers and one with the geometric mean, which probably underestimates, as it is higher influenced by lower values in our case. As the higher expenses do not explicit mean outliers, because they could be real expenses but for more expensiv treatment method. Another problem with this extrapolation is that our survey data must not represent the population, see section limitations. Therefore, we should refrain from extrapolation and only talk about the observed data. Neverthetless we can see that the agent market is logically growin with the higher numbers of colonies in Austria and is could be in total each year between 3 and 5 million euros worth. This money is spend each year by the beekeepers in Austria on treatment against the varroa mite. This number does not even account for the hours of labour, which each treatment method requires. On the other side the economical costs of prevent loosing colonies is still lower than the loss of the colony if no prevention against the varroa mite was done. In an study the loss of one colony in Austria was estimated with 318 Euro [@popovskastojanov2021].

## Operational Factor Analysis


Looking at the single factor analysis we see that the highest differences in the selected operational question is between small beekeeping operations 25 or less colonies and bigger operations is. It makes sense that bigger operations try to be more economical, but it also makes sense that some investments are more expensive for smaller operations, as you can only use them for a smaller number of colonies. Lets take for example the oxalic acid sublimation tools, they can cost between ..... If a beekeeper manages 5 colonies the investment is ten times higher than for a beekeeper with 50 colonies. That the other two operational question come to the conclusion that migratory beekeper and certified organic beekeeper are also spending less than the counterpart, can only partly be explained by the interaction of these groups (Fig. \@ref(fig:distr-groups)). As the third and fourth most common group in our survey are recreational beekeeper (<= 25 colonies) which are certified organic or migratory beekeeper. The reason is probably simply because the smaller operational beekeeper are the majority in our survey. Both operational questions are probably saying something about the professionalism, which is also believed to interact with the yearly colony loss rate [@oberreiter2020]. This professionalism which leads to lower loss rates possible also come to the conses of lower expenses and more economical colony managment. The difference in this later mentined two operational question is not as big as the operation size and in the multiple regression model the effect is too small to be of significant impact.

## Predictive Power

The multiple regression model shows us that the predictive power of the asked questions on the expenses per colony is very low and would be not sufficient to make any predictive tools. This result tells us multiple things why the variation of expenses inside the treatment methods is too high treatment methods often include a wide variety of possible tools and treatments, example different models for 'Hyperthermia' or frequency and application tools of 'Formic acid' treatment. Also most participants probably only give rough estimates on their expenses per colony, which will be rounded up and down.

## Efficancy & Economics

Interpretation careful as confidence intervals for loss rates are overlapping between combinations and the standard errors for expenses are rather wide. 

One of the least efficient and also economical treatment method was the single application of formic acid long term treatment in summer.
