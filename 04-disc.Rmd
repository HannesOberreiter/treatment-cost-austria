## Sample Representative and Limitations

Although the popularity and rise of new beekeepers in Austria, a decrease in absolute and relative numbers of participants over the three survey years was observed (Table&nbsp;@ref(tab:registered)). I would have expected the opposite of an increase because in 2016 new rules made it obligatory for beekeepers who want to participate in the bee health program to fill out the yearly winter loss survey. Beekeeper who are part of the bee health programme are allowed to apply and/or receive a higher rate of government aid for investments in technical equipment to improve production quality and hygiene in their beekeeping operation.^[AgrarMarkt Austria, 06/2021 - Version 04] Before this indirect monetary incentive, there were no advantages or personal rewards for participants in the voluntary survey. Incentives showed in an analysis of two meta-studies an increase of survey responses and also a lower drop-out rate [@goritz2006]. However, the effect or higher motivation due to incentives is comparatively small [@goritz2006;@bruggen2011]. One of the strong major motivations for beekeeper to participate in citizens science ecological field studies is to be able to contribute to the scientific knowledge [@gratzer2021]. This high rate of participants with intrinsically motivation was also identified for online surveys [@bruggen2011]. The winter colony loss survey is likely an in-between and cannot be described purely as a citizens science study or an ordinary online survey. Nevertheless, to increase and improve the retention of beekeepers participating in the project should strive for better communication on how it improves the beekeeping knowledge and identify ways to acknowledge each personal contribution [@nov2014]. One idea would be a personalized automated report of the survey results, were the independent results are compared to the total observed results. This could be perceived as an acknowledge service of a free professional data analysis for the volunteers, which is one of the motivations for citizens scientists [@gratzer2021].

As with the majority of monitoring survey studies, the design is subject to limitations especially in their representativeness. From a statistical standpoint, we cannot say our sample represents the beekeeper population in Austria as the sample was not selected at random from the population [@vanderzee2013]. In Austria all beekeepers must officially register in VIS[^r-vis], but access to this data is limited and only available for prevention of diseases. A random stratified selection out of all beekeepers would be an ideal situation, which would help to prevent potential selection biases and survey errors [@heeringa2010;@vanderzee2013]. With this in mind point estimates and results should be viewed with caution. The participating beekeepers in the survey are from close to all country districts, indicating a thorough spatial coverage, and a response rate of 3.5-4.0% summarises to around 1.000 participants each year. Based on the rules of thumbs from @roscoe1975, a multivariate analyses should typically comprise 10% more responses than questions and cover all answering groups with an appropriate number of answers (*n*=30). In addition for permutation tests, which were used in the two level factor analysis (Section \@ref(two-level)), the combination of skewed data and unequal sample sizes could lead to possible loss of power [@christensen2021]. To account for the low sample sizes in certain groups the three years of surveys can help to view certain results as more robust, if the same results were observed in each year, or weak, if this is not the case. For the second concern a rank based permutation test was performed with bootstrap confidence interval to not merely rely on a single point estimate and visualize the test results.

Methodically a lot of care was undertaken to identify outliers and imputation of some answers. For good practice and to minimize arbitrary decisions different statistical methods were applied and my knowledge about the different expenses of various treatment methods was taken into account [@kwak2017]. However, this imputation, which can be seen as an act of data manipulation, should not be taken too lightly. With my methodical transparent approach and the public availability of the source code I try to take care of possible arguments of manipulative intentions. The reported inference based statistics are without correction of the alpha error, since different hypotheses are tested in the questionnaire as it is mostly explorative and possible overlaps of the hypotheses are difficult to classify. The advantage of the COLOSS questionnaire is that the questions are the same over several years. This is typically because of interactions with temporal effects for example the weather which has shown to impact the winter colony survival [@switanek2017;@becsi2021]. The repetition additionally helps to reduce the probability of mistaken inferences in statistics, if consistent results can be observed over multiple years. The questionnaire itself can be seen as a tool to identify possible risk factors and compare the results in a standardised way with other countries part of COLOSS [@brodschneider2016;@brodschneider2018]. The identified risk factors can then be followed up by research with specific experimental design, for example the observed crippled wings by beekeepers with a study about the viral load [@morawetz2019].

Another point which may represent a limitation is the survey data quality. Especially for the question about estimated treatment expenses per colony without labor costs. The data distribution showed participants mostly answered in full round numbers, eg. 5 or 10 euro. This rounding leads to less variance between groups. Beekeepers answering on this question without ordinary estimates would need to keep books on their expenses or invest more effort when answering the survey, to find out how much they actually spend. I believe this is not the case for the majority, as most participants presumably regard beekeeping as a hobby and do not keep track of their expenses. Additionally, the position of the question in the questionnaire could cause a negative effect as it placed at the end of the survey. Although the structure does not seem to portray a major role on data quality in a postal survey [@dunn2003].

## Motivation choosing Varroa Control Method

The motivation why participants practise a specific method was a novel question and was only asked in the last survey year. 'Efficacy' (67.3%) which was picked by the majority, as one of the categories, is the most relevant factor. The obvious follow up question would be, how do the participant know the chosen control method is efficient. In Austria the treatment methods are dominated by organic acids and the loss rates for these methods are similar [@oberreiter2020]. The majority follows the official recommendation of formic acid after honey harvest in summer and oxalic acid treatment in winter [@moosbeckhofer2015]. In comparison to Czech, which showed in four successive winters a lower loss rate than Austria, synthetic acaricides are common (eg. Amitraz) and can even be commanded by the authorities if the varroa infestation level is unacceptably high [@brodschneider2019a]. Even though synthetic acaricides show a specific and effectiveness against the Varroa mite, residues and resistance remain a problem [@rosenkranz2010;@noel2020;@kast2021]. The motivation category 'Residues' (42.9%) is the third most picked category in the survey, showing the survey participants are aware of the problem, especially the bigger beekeeping operations. 'Resistances' was selected by 17.1% and seem for most not a primary motivation for choosing their Varroa control method. The category 'Resistances' is more of a concern or motivational reason for their treatment choice to bigger operation in Austria (28%). The problem of resistances with synthetic acaricides can be minimized by employing different methods in each year [@noel2020]. In Austria the high concern or possible knowledge of 'Residues' and 'Resistances' could be the reason, why compared to the treatment strategy Czech or the practices of sideline and commerical U.S. beekeepers, the use of synthetic acaricides is rather low [@underwood2019;@brodschneider2019a]. On the other side, that 'Residues' is a higher motivation than 'Resistances' could be because the low usage of synthetic acaricides and beekeepers are not as afraid of resistances because they did not experience it.

The second most picked answer in the survey represent 'Side effects on bees' (49%). Probably all treatment methods can have side effects on honeybees, but research on this topic is not available for all products. The accumulation of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos in the bees wax can lead to toxic levels for larvae [@kast2020]. The organic formic acid is highly dependent on outside temperature and the fumes can damage adult bees and larvae [@underwood2003;@bolli1993]. Various treatment methods also showed under controlled conditions negative influence on the gen expression for memory of adult honeybees [@gashout2020]. Overdoses of oxalic acid trickling in winter can lead to higher bee mortality [@charriere2002;@adjlane2016].

In the survey the most common sole answer was 'Recommendations from beekeeping associations, extension workers, veterinarians, magazines, etc.' (*n*=16), which was picked in total by 26.1%. It is also more dominant motivation for 'Recreational Beekeepers' than for bigger operations. The result shows that around one-fourth in our survey are motivated by external resources in their decision making. This demonstrate the importance of knowledge transfer in the beekeeping community and of projects like B-RAP from COLOSS, which tries to improve the information flow between beekeepers and scientific results and vice versa [@kristiansen2021]. For example the communication of ways for integrated pest management (IPM) in beekeeping could be fruitful as it would be one way to measure 'Efficacy', lower 'Residues' and 'Side effects on bees' and minimize the chance of 'Resistances' [@roth2020;@bubnic2021]. Only a small amount of beekeepers are picking their treatment methods purely from 'Habitat', showing that beekeepers are somewhat flexible and willing to change their methods. A U.S. national survey identified two main groups of beekeepers in their varroa management beliefs, the first one 'Treatment Skeptics', which were less likely to treat and 'Treatment Adherents' who active try to keep bees healthy [@thoms2019]. The authors discuss further that communication needs to be adapted to these two beliefer-types and beekeepers should be made aware that their decision in management practices also influences neighbouring colonies to prevent upcoming conflicts between the groups [@thoms2019]. In our survey we can see clearly two different goals and motivations for selecting varroa treatment methods based on the operation size. Where motivations on some parts as for 'Efficacy' overlap but on other parts are quite different, for example in the categories 'Residues' or 'Recommendations'. Beekeeping management differentiation and philosophy if categorized based on operation size was also found in a study from the U.S., whereas the employed practices from commerical and sideline beekeepers did differ significantly from backyard beekeepers [@underwood2019].

Interestingly the category 'Economic Costs' was only picked by 6.4% of the participants, showing the expenses are only a low motivational driver for choosing a specific method. @thoms2019 showed in their U.S. survey that 'Money' was reported as one of the main disadvantages of managing varroa mites at fourth place after 'Kills, weakens, or hurts bees', 'Chemicals in colony' and 'Time'. As most beekeepers in Austria are hobbyists it is apparently of no surprise that economic is no major motivation factor for keeping bees and the expenses for treatment against varroa, even tough some can be substitutional, are low in comparison to other expenses, for example sugar or costs of hives. That the economic categories are more of a motivational factor for bigger operations (>25 colonies) can also be seen in the results, as the categories 'Economic Costs' and 'Time and number of applicants' were more frequently chosen.

## Data Distribution and Estimation 

The non normal distribution of reported treatment expenses per colony with a mean of EUR&nbsp;11.1 and median EUR&nbsp;9 was expected, because costs for the different treatment methods in investment, material and consumables vary (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:distr-year)). Although not directly comparable, in a US research paper about the pollination markets they went with an approximating of USD&nbsp;18 per colony for treatment consumables and application costs [@rucker2012]. Adjusted for inflation this would be USD&nbsp;44 which are EUR&nbsp;39.[^exchange] This estimate likely additionally includes the labour costs in application, which was not the case in our survey. A survey from Albania showed that acaricides only account for a minor percentage of the production costs and drug treatment did account on average for 5% of the total work load in beekeeping operations [@dedej2000]. Sadly the paper does not report the data in sufficient manner to extract more information. Nevertheless, compared to the loss when colonies do not survive the winter, which was estimated with EUR&nbsp;318 in Austria [@popovskastojanov2021], the treatment expenses purely on an economic standpoint are rather worthwhile. At least if the treatment method is also efficient enough to prevent colony losses due to varroa mites. This is only the direct economic loss for the beekeeper, as the indirect socio-economic loss is even much higher due to honeybees important activity as pollinator for our food supply [@southwick1992].

As there are no previous market analyses or pilot studies in Austria, I implemented the calculated estimates to successfully validate the survey results for plausibility (Table&nbsp;\@ref(tab:table-estimates)). The overlap of survey responses and estimated expenses, despite the fact that they are on average similar to show some differences when looking at the survey treatment method combinations. One of these overestimations are combinations including 'Another Biotechnical Method', excluding the separately asked methods 'Hyperthermia' and 'Drone brood removal'. One reason for the wrong estimation is that the method itself includes a broad range of applications and was difficult to calculate, eg. less expensive small plastic clip for queen caging compared to the more expensive full frame stainless steel cages. Another reason could be the more sophisticated calculation of the yearly depreciation of investment and material costs. The underestimation of the two exclusive use of formic acid treatment methods could be due to the application frequencies, as in the estimate I only calculate one application per month. Additionally, we only compared in this case the arithmetic mean expenses, which is influenced by outliers as shown by the underestimated treatment combination of summer and winter oxalic acid trickling of readymade mixture. Although a lot of care taken before the analysis, this is one of the reasons why I look only at treatment method combinations with at least 15 answers.

## Extrapolation

The varroa treatment agent market was to my knowledge never before estimated in Austria. The total market value increased with the growing number of colonies registered in Austria over the three survey years. In total value as a rough extrapolation this is mean expenses of EUR 3 to 5 million for each year. That these numbers are only rough estimates is shown by the interpolation of the survey total expenses, where the value of the real survey total sum lies between the two applied methods (Table&nbsp;\@ref(tab:extrapolation-tab)). The arithmetic mean as one method, which is influenced by high outliers and the geometric mean as second method, which probably underestimates as it is higher influenced by lower values in our case. Nevertheless, the extrapolation shows a possible economical burden for Austrian beekeepers as direct impact of an introduced aggressor since its extend into Europa in the 1980s [@griffiths1981;@potts2010a]. This calculated value does not even account for the hours of labour, which each treatment method requires. The costs for treating against varroa mites and preventing possible colony losses is still lower than the loss of the colony if no prevention against the varroa mite was carried out. As shown in a multi-country study the estimated combined national economic losses due to colony losses and weak colonies over winter in the year 2016/17 sums to an estimate of EUR&nbsp;32 million in Austria [@popovskastojanov2021]. As a matter of course colony losses are not caused by varroa mites alone, but comprise a combination multiple abiotic and biotic factors [@neov2019]. Even so, a acute degree of parasitisation is correlated with a multiple of negative effects on the honeybee colony and their individuals and in the worst case it can lead to their death [e.g. @rosenkranz2010;@noel2020;@morawetz2019;@traynor2020].

## Operational Factor Analysis

All selected operational questions did show in the two levels factor analysis a statistically significant difference in their expenses per colony. The highest difference was between small beekeeping operations with 25 or less colonies, which can be seen as recreational beekeepers, and bigger operations with more colonies, who can be seen as side-line and more professional beekeepers. As for winter colony losses it was shown before that bigger sized operations are loosing less colonies [e.g. @lee2015;@brodschneider2018;@gray2020]. The reasons for lower losses and lower expenses could be in their different beliefs and following practices to manage the varroa mite [@thoms2019;@underwood2019]. Bigger operations are financially driven and and their goals are probably more economical [@underwood2019]. Additionally some investments are more expensive for smaller operations, as you can only use them for a smaller number of colonies, e.g. sublimation tool for oxalic acid.

That the other two operational question come to the conclusion that migratory beekeepers and certified organic beekeepers are also spending less than the counterpart, can only partly be explained by the interaction of these groups and the operation size (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:distr-groups)). As the third and fourth most common group in our survey are recreational beekeepers (<= 25 colonies) which are certified organic or migratory beekeepers. Both operational are an indicator for experience and professionalism, which is also believed to be one of the main reasons for lower colony losses [@lee2015;@underwood2019;@oberreiter2020]. This professionalism which leads to lower loss rates probably also leads to a more economical colony management. However, the outcome for certified organic beekeeper was not expected, as I expected higher expenses. @underwood2019 showed in their beekeeping management study in the U.S. that organic beekeepers tend to use biotechnical and alternative treatment methods. As shown in the estimate calculation, these methods were overestimated and in the later section of efficacy and economics it is shown that 'Another Biotechnical Method' treatments are actually less expensive than the other ones applied. On this note, the difference in expenses in the two levels for the two operational factors is lower than the operational size and in the multiple regression model the effect is too small to be of significant impact.

## Multiple Regression

The accuracy of the selected factors in a multiple regression model for estimating correctly the expenses per colony is rather low. If the only goal is to predict the expenses, adding additional features from the survey and using more sophisticated methods like supervised ML or a 'black box'-variant could be a viable option [@sarker2021]. My inference based regression approach is simple and the sample size is limiting. The advantage of the selected linear regression models is that it can accommodate both prediction and explanation. Additionally, more samples or in my case participants would probably not increase the model fit, as the variation inside the selected factors is too spread, but better analysis of some treatment methods with low rates of application would be possible.

Nevertheless, the results from the regression model with number of colonies indicate the low explanatory value of the two operational question 'Certified Organic Beekeepers' and 'Migratory Beekeeper' as additional covariates. The two factors were previously discussed in the operational factor analysis as single factor analysis. In the model and now with finer resolution of colony numbers, than in the two level factor analysis, the possible correlations between the operational questions and colony numbers are probably one of the reasons for the low gains.

In addition the model shows the variation of expenses per colony inside the treatment methods. The asked methods in the questionnaire to include a wide variety of possible tools and treatment application. For example different investment into equipment for 'Hyperthermia' or frequency and application tools of 'Formic acid' treatment.

Interesting is that 'Another Biotechnical Method' is the only treatment method, besides 'Lactic Acid', which reduces the estimate if applied. The same trend can be seen in the following efficacy and economics section. The forced brood break with biotechnical methods showed in field studies promising results [@lodesani2019;@buchler2020]. The treatment methods 'Synthetic Methods', 'Hyperthermia' and 'Thymol' did increase the estimate for expenses per colony if applied the most. This products are compared to organic acids are more expensive as consumables or for 'Hyperthermia' in their investment. From the three different available oxalic treatment options the 'Oxalic acid - sublimation' did increase the estimate the least, showing that it is a less expensive option compared two the ready-made mix or pure trickling solution. Although, the investment of sublimation tools is more expensive as it can be used over multiple years and for multiple colonies the low amount of oxalic acid needed would possible offset this investment quickly. In addition in field studies the sublimation of oxalic acid showed better results compared to trickling or no treatment [@altoufailia2015].


## Efficacy & Economics

In Austria the most common treatment methods are organic acids (eg. formic acid, oxalic acid), whereas oxalic acid is more or less the sole option for the last treatment in autumn [@oberreiter2020]. Although, alternative for example 'Hyperthermia' to exist, they are only applied by a minority. Each treatment method has their own strengths and weaknesses [@rosenkranz2010;@noel2020]. As some treatment methods are more dependent on outside environmental conditions like temperate or humidity, the multiple year approach allows me to find out which treatment methods are efficient on average over multiple years. Nevertheless, interpretation of the results in my case are on point estimates but confidence intervals for loss rates are overlapping between most treatment combinations. The same is true for the expenses per colonies, as the variation is high and low sample size for some treatments resulting in wide standard errors.

The most common treatment combination in over the three years of survey was long term formic acid in summer followed by oxalic acid trickling in winter (**A** 'SU-Fa-LT & WI-Ox-pure'). The combination of formic acid in summer and oxalic acid in winter is the national recommendation for Austrian beekeepers [@moosbeckhofer2015]. The combination showed on average consistently low loss rates but only in one year low expenses. Formic acid evaporation is known to be effective and low risk of residues or resistances [@rosenkranz2010;@noel2020]. The long term treatment variant compared to to the short term variant with the same combination, which showed in each year higher losses (**E** 'SU-Fa-ST & WI-Ox-pure'), shows a better efficiency. This was also observed previously in Austria [@oberreiter2020]. The difference here could be the disadvantages of using formic acid as it is dependent on outside temperature and humidity and can have a negative impact on the health of honeybees by high concentrations [@bolli1993;@underwood2003;@noel2020]. The long term evaporation variant could be due to the longer exposure time inside the colony be more efficient and less influenced from the outside temperature, therefore resulting in better efficiency. It is typically applied with a smaller exposure area, resulting in less evaporation of formic acid at a time. One of the least efficient and expensive treatment method was the single application of formic acid long term treatment in summer (**M** 'SU-Fa-LT'). This shows that only a single treatment in summer is not enough and a treatment in late autumn should be recommended. Interesting was that the trickling of oxalic acid as pure or ready-made mixture did perform in the same combination better than the oxalic acid sublimation (**B** 'SU-Fa-LT & WI-Ox-sub'). In addition oxalic acid sublimation in summer and winter (**F** 'SU-Ox-sub & WI-Ox-sub') was less expensive but on average with higher loss rates. In a direct comparison the sublimation of oxalic acid showed better results than the trickling or spraying [@altoufailia2015]. Oxalic acid does only work effective in bloodless periods [@rosenkranz2010;@noel2020]. Therefore, I expect that beekeeper performing in summer the sublimation repeat it multiple times to be effective, but we do not have any more information on the frequency or how they applied it. As a reminder the confidence interval between the treatments is overlapping showing that statistically there is no significant difference between the treatment combinations and showing the weakness of the analysis purely on the point estimate. 

One way to minimize the amount of acaricides usage is with biotechnical methods. This combinations, without drone brood removal or hyperthermia, were on average more economically than the formic acid treatments, without this methods, in summer. On efficacy the point estimates showed for the combinations using biotechnical methods higher loss rates. Previously in Austria the usage of biotechnical methods in summer in direct comparison to the beekeepers who don't use these methods showed significant lower loss rates [@crailsheim2018;@oberreiter2020]. The methods are often labour intensive and the positives effect of being more economically without labour costs could be diminished if one accounts for this [@rosenkranz2010;@buchler2020]. Nevertheless, the usage of biotechnical methods showed in field studies good results and can be seen as a good alternative and addition for integrated pest management (IPM) [@lodesani2019;@buchler2020].
