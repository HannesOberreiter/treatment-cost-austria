## Sample Representative and Limitations

Although the popularity and rise of new beekeepers in Austria, a decrease in absolute and relative numbers of participants over the three survey years was observed (Table&nbsp;\@ref(tab:registered)). I would have expected the opposite of an increase because in 2016 new rules made it obligatory for beekeepers who want to participate in the bee health programm to fill out the yearly winter loss survey. Beekeeper who are part of the bee health programme are allowed to apply and/or get a higher rate of government aid for investments in technical equipment to improve production quality and hygiene in their beekeeping operation.^[AgrarMarkt Austria, 06/2021 - Version 04] Before this indirect monetary incentive, there were no advantages or personal rewards for participants in the voluntary survey. Incentives showed in an analysis of two meta-studies an increase of survey responses and also a lower drop-out rate [@goritz2006]. However, the effect or higher motivation due to incentives is rather small [@goritz2006;@bruggen2011]. One of the strong major motivation for beekeeper to participate in citizens science ecological field studies is to be able to contribute to the scientific knowledge [@gratzer2021]. This high rate of participants with intrinsically motivation was also identified for online surveys [@bruggen2011]. The winter colony loss survey is probably an in-between and cannot be described purely as a citizens science study or a simple online survey. Nevertheless, to increase and improve the retention of beekeepers participating the project should strive for better communication on how it improves the beekeeping knowledge and find ways to acknowledge each personal contribution [@nov2014]. One idea would be a personalized automated report of the survey results, were the individual results are compared to the total observed results. This could be seen as an acknowledge service of a free professional data analysis for the volunteers, which is one of the motivations for citizens scientists [@gratzer2021].

As with the majority of monitoring survey studies, the design is subject to limitations especially in their representativeness. From a statistical standpoint, we cannot say that our sample represents the beekeeper population in Austria as the sample was not selected randomly from the population [@vanderzee2013]. In Austria all beekeepers must officially register in VIS[^r-vis], but access to this data is limited and only available for prevention of diseases. A random stratified selection out of all beekeepers would be an ideal situation, which would help to prevent potential selection biases and survey errors [@heeringa2010;@vanderzee2013]. With this in mind point estimates and results should be viewed with caution. The participating beekeeper in the survey are from close to all country districts, indicating a good spatial coverage, and a response rate of 3.5-4.0% summarises to around 1.000 participants each year. Based on the rules of thumbs from @roscoe1975, a multivariate analyses should typically have 10% more responses than questions and cover all answering groups with an appropriate number of answers (*n*=30). In addition for permutation tests, which were used in the two level factor analysis (Section \@ref(two-level)), the combination of skewed data and unequal sample sizes could lead to possible loss of power [@christensen2021]. To account for the low sample sizes in certain groups the three years of survey can help to view certain results as more robust, if the same results were observed in each year, or weak, if this is not the case. For the second concern a rank based permutation test was performed with bootstrap confidence interval to not only rely on a single point estimate and visualize the test results.

Methodically a lot of care was taken to identify outliers and imputation of some answers. For good practice and to minimize arbitrary decisions different statistical methods were applied and my knowledge about the different expenses of various treatment methods were taken into account [@kwak2017]. Still, this imputation, which can be seen as an act of data manipulation, should not be taken too lightly. With my methodical transparent approach and the public availability of the source code I try to take care of possible arguments of manipulative intentions. The reported inference based statistics are without correction of the alpha error, since different hypotheses are tested in the questionnaire as it is mostly explorative and possible overlaps of the hypotheses are difficult to classify. The advantage of the COLOSS questionnaire is that the questions are the same over several years, this is mainly because of interactions with temporal effects for example the weather which has shown to impact the winter colony survival [@switanek2017;@becsi2021]. The repetition additionally helps to reduce the probability of false inferences in statistics, if the same results can be observed over multiple years. The questionnaire itself can be seen as a tool to identify possible risk factors and compare the results in a standardised way with other countries part of COLOSS [@brodschneider2016;@brodschneider2018]. The identified risk factors can then be followed up by research with specific experimental design, for example the observed crippled wings by beekeepers with a study about the viral load [@morawetz2019].

Another point which may is a limitation is the survey data quality. Especially for the question about estimated treatment expenses per colony without labor costs. The data distribution showed that participants mostly answered in full round numbers, eg. 5 or 10 euro. This rounding leads to less variance between groups. Beekeepers answering on this question without simple estimates would need to keep books on their expenses or spend more effort when answering the survey, to find out how much they actually spend. I believe that this is not the case for the majority, as most participants probably see beekeeping as a hobby and do not keep track of their expenses. Additionally, the position of the question in the questionnaire could have a negative effect as it placed at the end of the survey. Although the structure does not seems to play a major role on data quality in postal survey [@dunn2003].

## Motivation choosing Varroa Control Method

The motivation why participants use a specific method was a novel question and was only asked out in the last survey year. 'Efficacy' (67.3%) which was picked by the majority as one selection is the most important factor. The obvious follow up question would be, how do the participant know that the chosen control method is efficient. In Austria the treatment methods are dominated by organic acids and the loss rates for these methods are similar [@oberreiter2020]. The majority follows the official recommendation of formic acid after honey harvest in summer and oxalic acid treatment in winter [@moosbeckhofer2015]. In comparison to Czech, which showed in four successive winters a lower loss rate than Austria, synthetic acaricides are common (eg. Amitraz) and can even be commanded by the authorities if the varroa infestation level is too high [@brodschneider2019a]. Even though synthetic acaricides show a specific and effectiveness against the Varroa mite, residues and resistance are a problem [@rosenkranz2010;@noel2020;@kast2021]. The motivation category 'Residues' (42.9%) is the third most picked category in the survey, showing that the survey participants are aware of the problem. 'Resistances' was only selected by 17.1% and seem for most not a main motivation for choosing their Varroa control method. The problem of resistances with synthetic acaricides can be minimized by applying different methods each year [@noel2020].

The second most picked answer in the survey was 'Side effects on bees' (49%). Probably all treatment methods can have side effects on honeybees but research on this topic is not available for all products. The accumulation of the synthetic acaricide coumaphos in the bees wax can lead to toxic levels for larvae [@kast2020]. The organic formic acid is highly dependent on outside temperature and the fumes can damage adult bees and larvae [@underwood2003;@bolli1993]. Various treatment methods also showed under controlled conditions negative influence on the gen expression for memory of adult honeybees [@gashout2020]. Overdoses of oxalic acid trickling in winter can lead to higher bee mortality [@charriere2002;@adjlane2016]. 

In the survey the most common single answer was 'Recommendations from beekeeping associations, extension workers, veterinarians, magazines, etc.' (*n*=16), which was picked in total by 26.1%. Indicating that one fourth are motivated by external resources in their decision making. Showing the importance of knowledge transfer in the beekeeping community and of projects like B-RAP from COLOSS, which tries to improve the information flow between beekeepers and scientific results and vice a versa [@kristiansen2021]. For example the communication of ways for integrated pest management (IPM) in beekeeping could be fruitful as it would be one way to measure 'Efficacy', lower 'Residues' and 'Side effects on bees' and minimize the chance of 'Resistances' [@roth2020;@bubnic2021].
 
Interestingly the category 'Economic Costs' was only picked by 6.4% of the participants, showing that the expenses are only a low motivational driver for choosing a specific method. As most beekeepers in Austria are hobbyists it is probably of no surprise that economic is no major motivation factor for keeping bees and the expenses for treatment against varroa, even tough some can be substitutional, are low in comparison to other expenses, for example sugar or costs of hives. 

## Data Distribution and Estimation 

The non normal distribution of reported treatment expenses per colony with a mean of EUR&nbsp;11.1 and median EUR&nbsp;9 was expected, because costs for the different treatment methods in investment, material and consumables vary (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:distr-year)). Although not directly comparable, in an US research paper about the pollination markets they went with an approximate of USD&nbsp;18 per colony for treatment consumables and application costs [@rucker2012]. Adjusted for inflation this would be USD&nbsp;44 which are EUR&nbsp;39.[^exchange] This estimate probably also includes the labour costs in application, which was not the case in our survey. A survey from Albania showed that acaricides only account for a small percentage of the production costs and drug treatment did account on average for 5% of the total work load in beekeeping operations [@dedej2000]. Sadly the paper does not report the data in sufficient manner to extract more information. Nevertheless, compared to the loss when colonies do not survive the winter, which was estimated with EUR&nbsp;318 in Austria [@popovskastojanov2021], the treatment expenses purely on an economic standpoint are rather worthwhile. At least if the treatment method is also efficient enough to prevent colony losses due to varroa mites.

As there are no previous market analyses or pilot studies in Austria, I used the calculated estimates to successfully validate the survey results for plausibility (Table&nbsp;\@ref(tab:table-estimates)). The overlap of survey responses and estimated expenses despite the fact that they are on average similar to show some differences when looking at the survey treatment method combinations. One of this overestimation are combinations including 'Another Biotechnical Method', excluding the separately asked methods 'Hyperthermia' and 'Drone brood removal'. One reason for the wrong estimation is that the method itself includes a broad range of applications and was difficult to calculate, eg. less expensive small plastic clip for queen caging compared to the more expensive full frame stainless steel cages. Another reason could be the more sophisticated calculation of the yearly depreciation of investment and material costs. The underestimation of the two single use of formic acid treatment methods could be due to the application frequencies, as in the estimate I only calculate one application per month. Additionally, we only compared in this case the arithmetic mean expenses, which is influenced by outliers as shown by the underestimated treatment combination of summer and winter oxalic acid trickling of ready made mixture. Although a lot of care taken before the analysis, this is one of the reasons why I look only at treatment method combinations with at least 15 answers.

## Extrapolation

The varroa treatment agent market was to my knowledge never before estimated in Austria. The total market value increased with the growing number of colonies registered in Austria over the three survey years. In total value as a rough extrapolation it means expenses of EUR&nbsp;3 to 5 million for each year. That this numbers are only rough estimates is shown by the interpolation of the survey total expenses, where the value of the real survey total sum lies between the two applied methods (Table&nbsp;\@ref(tab:extrapolation-tab)). The the arithmetic mean as one method, which is influenced by high outliers and the geometric mean as second method, which probably underestimates as it is higher influenced by lower values in our case. Nevertheless, the extrapolation shows a possible economical burden for Austrian beekeepers as direct impact of an introduced aggressor since its  extend into europa in the 1980s [@griffiths1981;@potts2010a]. This calculated value does not even account for the hours of labour, which each treatment method requires. The costs for treating against varroa mites and preventing possible colony losses is still lower than the loss of the colony if no prevention against the varroa mite was done. As shown in a multi-country study the estimated total national economic losses due to colony losses and weak colonies over winter in the year 2016/17 sums to an estimate of EUR&nbsp;32 million in Austria [@popovskastojanov2021]. Of course colony losses are not caused by varroa mites alone, but are a combination multiple abiotic and biotic factors [@neov2019]. Yet, a high degree of parasitisation is correlated with a multiple of negative effects on the honeybee colony and their individuals and in the worst case it can lead to their death [e.g. @rosenkranz2010;@noel2020;@morawetz2019;@traynor2020].

## Operational Factor Analysis

Looking at the single factor analysis we see that the highest differences in the selected operational question is between small beekeeping operations 25 or less colonies and bigger operations is. It makes sense that bigger operations try to be more economical, but it also makes sense that some investments are more expensive for smaller operations, as you can only use them for a smaller number of colonies. Lets take for example the oxalic acid sublimation tools, they can cost between ..... If a beekeeper manages 5 colonies the investment is ten times higher than for a beekeeper with 50 colonies. That the other two operational question come to the conclusion that migratory beekeper and certified organic beekeeper are also spending less than the counterpart, can only partly be explained by the interaction of these groups (Fig.&nbsp;\@ref(fig:distr-groups)). As the third and fourth most common group in our survey are recreational beekeeper (<= 25 colonies) which are certified organic or migratory beekeeper. The reason is probably simply because the smaller operational beekeeper are the majority in our survey. Both operational questions are probably saying something about the professionalism, which is also believed to interact with the yearly colony loss rate [@oberreiter2020]. This professionalism which leads to lower loss rates possible also come to the conses of lower expenses and more economical colony managment. The difference in this later mentined two operational question is not as big as the operation size and in the multiple regression model the effect is too small to be of significant impact.

## Predictive Power

The multiple regression model shows us that the predictive power of the asked questions on the expenses per colony is very low and would be not sufficient to make any predictive tools. This result tells us multiple things why the variation of expenses inside the treatment methods is too high treatment methods often include a wide variety of possible tools and treatments, example different models for 'Hyperthermia' or frequency and application tools of 'Formic acid' treatment. Also most participants probably only give rough estimates on their expenses per colony, which will be rounded up and down.

## Efficancy & Economics

Interpretation careful as confidence intervals for loss rates are overlapping between combinations and the standard errors for expenses are rather wide. 

One of the least efficient and also economical treatment method was the single application of formic acid long term treatment in summer.
